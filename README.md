The new version of Euphemia, available in Mac OS Sequoia, version 18.0d1e1, with improved letter spacing and correct Carrier glyph. It also supports midline finals for the Dakelh language.

In this version, there are several improvements, including:
* The difference between ᔆ (U+1506) and ᣵ (U+18F5)
* With 12 extra PUA characters for Dakelh finals and a Nunavit "angma".
* An improved design of the Carrier Hwi.
